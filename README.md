# MIDAS

A self-hosted, **Bloomberg-style market terminal** you run yourself. Type
mnemonic commands (`AAPL DES`, `NVDA GP`, `W`, `N`) into a command line to spawn
tiling panels — quotes, charts, watchlists, news — across a dense, dark
workspace. Inspired by [Gödel Terminal](https://godelterminal.com).

> Status: **v0.1 — foundation.** A working end-to-end vertical slice (command
> bar → tiling panels → live-updating modules → pluggable data backend). Built
> to grow for months. See the [Roadmap](#roadmap).
>
> **Direction:** Midas is heading toward a command-driven, self-hosted,
> **crypto-native** terminal (CCXT, no API keys). See [`VISION.md`](./VISION.md)
> and the [competitive teardown](./docs/research/godel-competitive-teardown.md).

## Highlights

- **Command-driven UI.** A Bloomberg-style command line with history,
  fuzzy autocomplete and "type anywhere to focus." `TICKER FUNCTION` grammar.
  A **⌘K / Ctrl-K command palette** fuzzy-jumps to any command or symbol.
- **Tiling panel workspace.** Drag, resize and arrange panels on a 12-column
  grid. Layout + watchlist persist in your browser.
- **Starter modules:** Description/quote (`DES`), price chart (`GP`/`GIP`),
  watchlist (`W`), quote monitor (`Q`), news (`N`/`TOP`), security finder
  (`SECF`), help (`HELP`).
- **Pluggable data layer.** Swap data sources behind one interface:
  - `mock` — deterministic synthetic market (default; works fully offline).
  - `yahoo` — live Yahoo Finance data (no API key).
- **Live ticker tape** and second-by-second market clock.
- **Typed end-to-end** with a shared data contract package.

## Quickstart

### Option A — Docker (one command, recommended)

Self-host the whole stack with [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/):

```bash
cp .env.example .env     # optional — defaults run the offline mock feed
docker compose up -d     # build + run web + API
```

Open <http://localhost:8080> and start typing: `BTC/USDT`, then `BTC/USDT GP`,
then `BTC/USDT BOOK`.

The **web** container (nginx) serves the built UI and reverse-proxies `/api`
(REST **and** the `/api/stream` WebSocket) to the **server** container, so the
browser talks to a single origin. Edit `.env` to switch providers or add your
`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, then `docker compose up -d --build` to apply.

```bash
docker compose logs -f      # tail logs
docker compose down         # stop
MIDAS_DATA_PROVIDER=ccxt MIDAS_WEB_PORT=9000 docker compose up -d --build   # live crypto on :9000
```

### Option B — local dev

```bash
# 1. Install (Node 20+ and pnpm)
pnpm install

# 2. Run web + API together (mock data, no network needed)
pnpm dev
#   → web:  http://localhost:5173
#   → api:  http://localhost:4000
```

Open <http://localhost:5173> and start typing: `BTC/USDT`, then `BTC/USDT GP`, then `BTC/USDT BOOK`.

### Use live market data

The API defaults to the offline `mock` provider. To pull **live** quotes,
charts and news from Yahoo Finance (no key required, needs internet):

```bash
MIDAS_DATA_PROVIDER=yahoo pnpm dev
```

For **live crypto** (no API key needed) via any [CCXT](https://github.com/ccxt/ccxt)
exchange — the cornerstone of Midas's [crypto-native direction](./VISION.md):

```bash
MIDAS_DATA_PROVIDER=ccxt MIDAS_CCXT_EXCHANGE=binance pnpm dev
# symbols use BASE/QUOTE, e.g. BTC/USDT, ETH/USDT
```

With the `ccxt` provider, the live order book, trades tape and ticker also stream
over **CCXT Pro** websockets (no API key needed for public market data).

| `AROON` | `AROONOSC`, `TRENDAGE` | no | Aroon board — trend by time-since-extreme per name: Aroon-Up / Aroon-Down (how recently the N-bar high vs low printed, 0–100) and the oscillator (up − down). Measures the age of the extreme, not price distance (distinct from HILO). |
| `CCI` | `CCI20`, `COMMODITY` | no | Commodity Channel Index board — each name's typical price vs its average ÷ mean deviation, with overbought (≥+100) / oversold (≤−100) flags: a mean-deviation oscillator distinct from RSI (gains/losses) and MFI (volume-weighted). |

| `PSAR` | `SAR`, `PARABOLIC` | no | Parabolic SAR board (Wilder stop-and-reverse) — the trailing-stop trend per name: long (stop below price) / short (stop above), the signed distance of the close from the stop, the acceleration factor (trend maturity), and a fresh-flip flag when the stop reverses. An iterative trailing-stop system, distinct from the ATR-band Supertrend (SUPER). |
| `WILLR` | `WILLIAMS`, `WPR` | no | Williams %R board — where each name's close sits in its N-bar high-low range on a 0 to −100 scale (0 = top, −100 = bottom), with overbought (≥−20) / oversold (≤−80) flags. A momentum oscillator close to Stochastic's %K but inverted and unsmoothed. |
| `UO` | `ULTIMATE`, `ULTOSC` | no | Ultimate Oscillator board (Larry Williams) — buying pressure ÷ true range blended over three timeframes (7/14/28) weighted 4:2:1 into a 0–100 reading per name, with overbought (≥70) / oversold (≤30) flags. Blends short/medium/long momentum to cut the false divergences single-period oscillators give. |
| `TRIX` | `TRIPLE`, `TRIXOSC` | no | TRIX board — the 1-period % rate-of-change of a triple-smoothed EMA of price per name, with its signal line (EMA of TRIX), the histogram (TRIX − signal), the zero-line side (up/down) and a fresh TRIX×signal cross. Triple smoothing filters the noise a single EMA leaves: a zero-line momentum oscillator, distinct from MACD (dual EMA). |
| `CMO` | `CHANDE`, `CMO14` | no | Chande Momentum Oscillator board — (Σ up-moves − Σ down-moves) ÷ their total × 100 over N bars per name, on a ±100 scale with overbought (≥+50) / oversold (≤−50) flags. Uses raw sums (not smoothed averages like RSI), so it swings harder: a distinct momentum gauge from the RSI / Stochastic / CCI family. |
| `ELDER` | `ELDERRAY`, `ERAY` | no | Elder-Ray board (Alexander Elder) — bull power (high − EMA) and bear power (low − EMA) per name as a % of the trend EMA, with the EMA slope as the up/down trend filter. Shows whether buyers or sellers control price relative to the trend: a buyer/seller-pressure board distinct from the oscillator family. |
| `FISHER` | `FISH`, `EHLERS` | no | Fisher Transform board (Ehlers) — normalizes each name's median price into its N-bar range and applies the Fisher transform to sharpen turning points, with the trigger line (prior Fisher) and a fresh Fisher×trigger cross. A reversal-oriented oscillator with crisper turns than the smooth momentum family. |
| `DPO` | `DETREND`, `DETRENDED` | no | Detrended Price Oscillator board — each name's close from floor(N/2)+1 bars ago minus its N-bar SMA (as a % of the SMA), with an above/below cycle-mean flag. Strips the trend to expose the price cycle around the average; reaches back (never forward) so the screener has no look-ahead. A cycle-oriented oscillator, distinct from the trend/momentum family. |
| `COPP` | `COPPOCK`, `COP` | no | Coppock Curve board — a 10-period weighted MA of each name's summed 14- and 11-bar rate-of-change, with its zero-line side and a fresh trough (up) / peak (down) turn. A trough turn near/below zero is Coppock's classic long-term buy signal: a slow, bottom-spotting momentum gauge distinct from the fast oscillator family. |
| `BOP` | `BALOP`, `BPOW` | no | Balance of Power board — (close − open) ÷ (high − low) per bar, smoothed over N bars on a −1..+1 scale, per name, with a buyers/sellers side and the latest candle's raw reading. Measures who won each candle (close vs open within the range): a simple buyer/seller-pressure gauge distinct from Elder-Ray. |
| `ADL` | `ACCDIST`, `CHAIKINAD` | no | Accumulation/Distribution line board (Chaikin) — the cumulative money-flow-volume line (close position in range × volume) per name, reported as its normalized slope over N bars (net flow ÷ volume), its trend, and a fresh N-bar A/D high (accumulation breakout) / low (distribution breakdown). A cumulative volume-flow gauge distinct from OBV. |
| `CMF` | `CHAIKINMF`, `CMFLOW` | no | Chaikin Money Flow board — Σ(money-flow volume) ÷ Σ(volume) over N bars per name, bounded −1..+1, with a buyers/sellers side and a strong-flow flag (\|CMF\| ≥ 0.25). The bounded oscillator sibling of the A/D line: positive is accumulation, negative distribution. |
| `FORCE` | `FORCEINDEX`, `EFI` | no | Force Index board (Elder) — (close − priorClose) × volume, EMA-smoothed over N bars per name, normalized as FI ÷ (price × avg volume) so it's comparable across names, with a bulls/bears side and a rising/falling flag. Ties the size of each move to the volume behind it: a zero-line volume oscillator. |
| `EOM` | `EMV`, `EASE` | no | Ease of Movement board (Arms) — midpoint move × range ÷ volume, SMA-smoothed over N bars per name and normalized to a dimensionless index, with an up/down ease side. Measures how readily price moves relative to the volume required: positive = rose easily (big move on light volume), negative = fell easily. A volume/price-efficiency oscillator. |
| `PVT` | `PRICEVOL`, `PVTREND` | no | Price Volume Trend board — the cumulative ((close − priorClose)/priorClose) × volume line per name, reported as its normalized slope over N bars (volume-weighted % return), its trend, and a fresh N-bar PVT high / low. Like OBV but scaled by the size of each move: a volume-confirmed trend line distinct from OBV and the A/D line. |
| `MASS` | `MASSINDEX`, `MASSIDX` | no | Mass Index board (Dorsey) — Σ over 25 bars of EMA9(range) ÷ EMA9(EMA9(range)) per name, with the reversal-bulge state: bulge (≥ 27), setup (bulged then awaiting the drop), fired (just fell below 26.5 — the reversal warning) or normal. Watches the high-low range expand then contract to anticipate turns; a volatility-of-range signal distinct from the directional oscillators. |
| `QSTICK` | `QSTK`, `QS` | no | Qstick board (Chande) — the average candle body (close − open) over N bars per name, as a % of price, with an up/down body-bias side. Above zero means up-closes dominated the window (buying bias), below zero down-closes (selling bias): a simple candle-body sentiment gauge. |
| `NVI` | `PVI`, `VOLINDEX` | no | Volume Index board — the Negative & Positive Volume Index per name (cumulative lines that compound the daily return only on down-volume days, NVI = "smart money", or up-volume days, PVI), each vs its own EMA signal. Reports NVI's distance from its EMA and the bull/bear regime of both — NVI above its EMA is the strongest bull-market tell. |
| `CFO` | `FORECAST`, `CHANDEFO` | no | Chande Forecast Oscillator board — 100 × (close − the least-squares regression-line fit over N bars) ÷ close, per name, on a zero line with an above/below-fit side. Measures how far price sits from its own regression trend: above zero means it's running ahead of the fit, below means it lags. A regression-based oscillator distinct from the moving-average family. |
| `RWI` | `RANDOMWALK`, `RWALK` | no | Random Walk Index board — per name, the max over look-backs k=2..N of price displacement ÷ (ATR(k)·√k), split into RWIhigh (up-trend strength) and RWIlow (down-trend strength). A reading ≥ 1 means price out-ran a same-volatility random walk — a genuine trend; below 1 reads as directionless noise. The signed RWI (+high / −low) sorts strongest up-trends → range → strongest down-trends. |
| `STC` | `SCHAFF`, `TRENDCYCLE` | no | Schaff Trend Cycle board — per name, a 0–100 cyclical oscillator that runs a stochastic over the 23/50 MACD line, then a second smoothed stochastic over that, so it turns earlier than a plain MACD. ≥ 75 and rising flags a strengthening up-cycle, ≤ 25 a down-cycle; crosses of 25 / 75 are the common triggers. Shows the STC level, its bar-over-bar change, and the bull/bear/mid zone. |
| `TSI` | `TRUESTRENGTH`, `TSTRENGTH` | no | True Strength Index board — per name, William Blau's double-smoothed momentum: 100 × EMA(EMA(Δclose, 25), 13) ÷ EMA(EMA(\|Δclose\|, 25), 13), with a 7-EMA signal line. Bounded ≈ ±100; above zero is net positive (bullish) momentum, below zero bearish, ±25 the common overbought/oversold extremes, and a cross of the signal line the usual trigger. Shows the TSI, its distance from the signal, and the OB/OS/mid zone. |
| `CRSI` | `CONNORS`, `CONNORSRSI` | no | Connors RSI board — Larry Connors' short-term mean-reversion composite, the average of three 0–100 parts: a 3-period Wilder RSI of the close, a 2-period RSI of the consecutive up/down streak, and the percent-rank of today's 1-bar return over the last 100 bars. Below 10 is washed-out (oversold), above 90 over-extended. Shows the composite plus each component (RSI / STRK / %R). |
| `KST` | `KNOWSURETHING`, `PRING` | no | Know Sure Thing board — Martin Pring's summed rate-of-change momentum: four ROCs (10/15/20/30) each SMA-smoothed, then weighted 1·2·3·4 and added (raw, un-normalized), with a 9-SMA signal line. Oscillates around zero — above zero and above its signal is bullish momentum, below is bearish, and signal crossovers are the trigger. Shows the KST, its distance from the signal, and the above/below-signal and above/below-zero state. |
| `KVO` | `KLINGER`, `KVOL` | no | Klinger Volume Oscillator board — Stephen Klinger's volume-force oscillator: a signed force (volume × \|2·(dm/cm − 1)\| × trend × 100, dm the daily range and cm its trend-cumulative measurement) run through EMA(34) − EMA(55), with a 13-EMA signal. Above zero / above its signal is net accumulation, below is distribution; zero-line and signal crossovers are the triggers. Volume-normalised so symbols compare; shows the value, its distance from the signal, and the accumulation/distribution state. |
| `RVGI` | `RVI`, `VIGOR` | no | Relative Vigor Index board — John Ehlers' conviction gauge: a 1·2·2·1-smoothed (close − open) summed over N bars ÷ the same smoothing of (high − low), with a 1·2·2·1-weighted signal line. Reads where price closes within its range — closing near the high is bullish vigor, near the low bearish. Oscillates around zero (≈ ±1); above the signal is bullish, below bearish, and RVI/signal crossovers are the triggers. |
| `WT` | `WAVETREND`, `WAVE` | no | Wave Trend Oscillator board — LazyBear's double-smoothed CCI on the typical price (hlc3): a 10-EMA channel, its 0.015-scaled mean deviation, normalised and run through a 21-EMA (wt1), versus a 4-SMA signal (wt2). Oscillates around zero (≈ ±60) with overbought at +53/+60 and oversold at −53/−60; wt1 crossing wt2 and the zero line are the triggers. Shows the WaveTrend, its distance from the signal, and the OB/OS zone. |
| `SMI` | `STOCHMOM`, `BLAU` | no | Stochastic Momentum Index board — William Blau's refined stochastic: 200 × the double-EMA-smoothed distance of close from the range midpoint ÷ the double-EMA-smoothed range, on ±100, with an EMA signal. Less noisy than a plain stochastic; above +40 is overbought, below −40 oversold, and SMI/signal and zero-line crossovers are the triggers. Shows the SMI, its distance from the signal, and the OB/OS zone. |
| `RMI` | `RELMOM`, `MOMRSI` | no | Relative Momentum Index board — Roger Altman's RSI generalised to an M-bar momentum: instead of the 1-bar change it Wilder-smooths the up/down moves of close vs close M bars ago, on a 0–100 scale (length 20, momentum 5). Smoother and less whippy than RSI; > 70 overbought, < 30 oversold, and with momentum = 1 it is exactly a 20-period RSI. Shows the RMI, its bar-over-bar change, and the OB/OS zone. |
| `DOSC` | `DERIV`, `DERIVOSC` | no | Derivative Oscillator board — Constance Brown's refined RSI momentum: a 14-period Wilder RSI double-smoothed by EMAs (5 then 3), minus a 9-period simple moving average of that double-smoothed RSI, plotted as a histogram. Above zero (and rising) is bullish momentum, below zero bearish, and the zero-line and DO/signal crossovers are the triggers. Shows the DOSC histogram, whether it's rising or falling, and the bull/bear side. |
| `PSO` | `PREMIER`, `PREMSTOCH` | no | Premier Stochastic board — Lee Leibfarth's stochastic refined to a crisp ±1: a fast %K (length 8) is normalised to 0.1·(%K−50), double-EMA-smoothed (period 5), then squashed through (e^ss−1)/(e^ss+1) = tanh. The exponential sharpens turns — PSO sits near ±1 only on a sustained smoothed extreme; > +0.9 is strongly overbought, < −0.9 strongly oversold, and zero-line crossovers are the triggers. Shows the PSO, its bar-over-bar change, and the OB/OS zone. |
| `VHF` | `VERTHOR`, `VHFILTER` | no | Vertical Horizontal Filter board — Adam White's trend-vs-chop regime gauge: the N-bar close range ÷ the sum of \|bar-to-bar close moves\|, i.e. directional travel over total wiggle, on a 0–1 scale. High (≳ 0.35) means an efficient trend (favour trend-following tools); low (≲ 0.20) means choppy churn (favour oscillators); rising VHF = strengthening trend. Shows the VHF, its bar-over-bar change, and the trend/chop/mid regime. |
| `PGO` | `PRETTYGOOD`, `PGOSC` | no | Pretty Good Oscillator board — Mark Johnson's mean-distance gauge: (close − N-period SMA) ÷ an N-period EMA of the true range, so the reading is in ATR units and comparable across symbols. Above zero means price is above its mean (uptrend bias), below zero below it; ±3 are the momentum-breakout extremes (a stretch of three average ranges from the mean). Default look-back 89. Shows the PGO, its absolute stretch, and the ±3 zone. |
| `IMPULSE` | `ELDERIMPULSE`, `IMP` | no | Elder Impulse System board — Dr. Elder's regime censor combining the 13-period EMA slope (trend) with the MACD-histogram slope (momentum): green/bull when both rise, red/bear when both fall, blue/neutral when they disagree or either is flat. Green forbids shorting, red forbids buying, neutral permits both, so a fresh flip on the latest bar is the signal. Shows each symbol's impulse (with a ·new flip tag), its EMA slope %, and histogram %, with an all-bars / fresh-flips filter. |
| `DISP` | `DISPARITY`, `DI` | no | Disparity Index board — Steve Nison's mean-distance gauge: 100 × (close − N-period EMA) ÷ EMA, i.e. price's percentage distance from its moving average, comparable across symbols regardless of price. Above zero means price trades above its mean (uptrend bias), below zero below it; large readings flag over-extension from the mean. Default look-back 14, with a 14 / 25 toggle. Shows the DI, its absolute stretch, and which side of the mean price sits on. |
| `TII` | `TRENDINTENSITY`, `TRENDINT` | no | Trend Intensity Index board — M.H. Pee's trend-strength oscillator (0–100): over the last half-period window, sum the close's positive deviations above its simple major-period SMA versus the absolute negative deviations below, then 100 × SDpos / (SDpos + SDneg). Above 50 means positive deviations dominate (uptrend bias), below 50 the reverse, ~50 trendless; the 80 / 20 bands mark a strong trend. Default 60-SMA with a 30-bar window (60 / 30 toggle). Shows the TII, its bar-over-bar change, and the trend band. |
| `CKS` | `CHANDEKROLL`, `KROLL` | no | Chande Kroll Stop board — Chande & Kroll's two-stage ATR trailing stops: preliminary highStop = highestHigh(p) − x·ATR and lowStop = lowestLow(p) + x·ATR, then the final stopShort = highest(highStop, q) (upper band) and stopLong = lowest(lowStop, q) (lower band) using a Wilder ATR. Close above the upper band is an uptrend break, below the lower band a downtrend break, in between is range. Default ATR(10) / stop 9, with a 1× / 3× ATR toggle. Shows the regime and the % distance to each stop. |
| `KAMA` | `KAUFMAN`, `ADAPTIVEMA` | no | KAMA trend board — Kaufman's Adaptive Moving Average, an EMA whose smoothing constant scales with the Efficiency Ratio (net directional travel ÷ total path), so it tracks fast in clean trends and flattens in chop. SC = (ER·(fast − slow SC) + slow SC)², KAMA recurses toward price. Default ER 10 / fast 2 / slow 30, with a 10 / 20 ER-period toggle. Shows the KAMA slope direction, the Efficiency Ratio %, and the % distance of price from KAMA. |
| `SMIE` | `SMIERGODIC`, `ERGODIC` | no | SMI Ergodic board — William Blau's ergodic momentum, which is the True Strength Index (double-EMA-smoothed price change ÷ the same smoothing of its absolute value, ×100) paired with an EMA signal line; the histogram is the SMI Ergodic Oscillator. Above zero is net bullish momentum, below bearish, and a signal-line cross (histogram sign flip) is the trigger. Default long 20 / short 5 / signal 5, with a 20 / 12 long-period toggle. Shows the indicator, the histogram, and any fresh bull/bear cross. |
| `RBOW` | `RAINBOW`, `RAINBOWOSC` | no | Rainbow Oscillator board — Mel Widner's rainbow of ten recursively-smoothed 2-period SMAs of close (each band a 2-SMA of the previous), read two ways, both normalized by the recent high-low range: RO = 100·(close − rainbow average) ÷ range (positive above the rainbow / negative below), and the bandwidth = 100·(widest band − narrowest band) ÷ range (wide = strong trend, narrow = consolidation). Default 10 bands with a 10 / 20 range-lookback toggle. Shows the oscillator, the bandwidth, and which side of the rainbow price sits on. |
| `TTF` | `TRENDTRIGGER`, `TRIGGERFACTOR` | no | Trend Trigger Factor board — M.H. Pee's range-geometry oscillator comparing the most recent N-bar high/low range against the prior N bars: buyPower = recent highest high − prior lowest low; sellPower = prior highest high − recent lowest low; TTF = 100·(buyPower − sellPower) ÷ (0.5·(buyPower + sellPower)). It oscillates around 0 and beyond ±100 — above +100 is a strong uptrend (buy), below −100 a strong downtrend (sell), in between is neutral. Default lookback 15 (so 30 bars), with a 15 / 30 toggle. Shows the TTF, its magnitude, and the buy/sell/flat zone. |
| `INRT` | `INERTIA`, `RVI` | no | Inertia board — Donald Dorsey's trend-persistence gauge: the Relative Volatility Index (RSI's twin, fed the rolling standard deviation of price bucketed up/down by close direction and Wilder-smoothed) then smoothed by a linear-regression line. Above 50 is positive inertia (the longer-term trend is up / bullish and tends to persist), below 50 negative; it moves slowly. Default stdev 10 / RVI 14 / linreg 20, with a 20 / 10 linreg toggle. Shows the Inertia, the raw RVI, and the bull/bear side. |
| `VSTOP` | `VOLSTOP`, `VOLATILITYSTOP`, `WVS` | no | Volatility Stop board — the Wilder Volatility System in its canonical TradingView `ta.vstop` form: a ratcheting ATR trailing stop. The stop trails a multiple of a Wilder ATR below price in an up-trend and above it in a down-trend, only ever tightening within a leg and jumping to the other side of price when the trend flips (close crossing the stop). Price at or above the stop is long / up-trend, below is short; DIST% is the signed cushion from price to the stop. Default length 20 · factor 2 (ta.vstop), with a faster Wilder-classic 7 · 3 preset. Shows the direction, the stop level, the distance %, and a ✦ on a fresh flip. |
| `GAPO` | `GRI`, `RANGEINDEX`, `GOPALAKRISHNAN` | no | Gopalakrishnan Range Index board — Jayanthi Gopalakrishnan's log-scaled range gauge: GAPO = ln(highest high − lowest low over N) ÷ ln(N), an unbounded measure of how wide a symbol's recent range is (rising = range expanding / volatility up, falling = contracting). The raw value scales with price level, so the board screens cross-symbol on the scale-invariant RANGE% (range as a % of price) by default and offers a GAPO-expansion (slope) sort, while the canonical GAPO is still shown per symbol. Default lookback N 5, with a 5 / 14 toggle. Shows the GAPO, the RANGE%, and whether the range is expanding or contracting. |
| `RSL` | `RELATIVESTRENGTH`, `LEVY`, `RSLEVY` | no | Relative Strength (Levy) board — Robert Levy's RSL = close ÷ SMA(close, N), a momentum / trend ratio of price against its own moving average. Above 1 the price leads its average (strong), below 1 it lags (weak), 1.0 sits on the average. As a ratio of two same-scale prices it is naturally scale-invariant and ranks cleanly across symbols; DEV% restates it as the % above/below the average. Default lookback N 130 (Levy's ~27-week window), with a faster 50 preset. Shows the RSL, the DEV%, and the strong/weak side. |
| `VRSI` | `VERVOORT`, `SMOOTHEDRSI`, `IFTRSI` | no | Vervoort Smoothed RSI board — Sylvain Vervoort's Smoothed RSI Inverse Fisher Transform (S&C, Oct 2010): close → rainbow average (a 10-deep cascade of 2-period weighted MAs blended 5,4,3,2,1,1,1,1,1,1 ÷ 20) → Wilder RSI → centred 0.1·(RSI−50) → zero-lag EMA (2·EMA1 − EMA2) → inverse Fisher (tanh) into a (−1…+1) line that snaps sharply between extremes. ≥ +0.5 overbought, ≤ −0.5 oversold (entries cross up through −0.5 / down through +0.5). Default 4 bars for both the RSI and the zero-lag EMA, with an 8/8 smoother preset. Shows the VRSI, its rising/falling direction, and the overbought/oversold zone. |

**Data flow:** the web client calls `/api/*` → Fastify routes → the active
`DataProvider`. In dev, Vite proxies `/api` to the server. Adding a data source
means implementing one interface (`apps/server/src/providers/types.ts`); adding
a panel type means writing a module component and registering it.

| `GET /api/alerts/log`              | recent server-fired triggers     |
| `GET/PUT /api/workspaces`          | the user's synced workspace layout|
| `GET/PUT /api/portfolio`           | the user's synced paper portfolio |
| `GET/PUT /api/watchlists`          | the user's synced named watchlists|
| `GET/PUT /api/notes`               | the user's synced notes          |
| `GET /api/auth/status`             | whether auth is on / signup open |
| `POST /api/auth/signup\|login`     | create a session (returns a token)|
| `GET /api/auth/me`                 | the signed-in user (bearer token)|
| `POST /api/auth/password`          | change password (rotates other sessions)|
| `POST /api/auth/logout-all`        | sign out other devices (token rotation)|
| `GET/DELETE /api/auth/users`       | admin: list / remove accounts    |

`/api/history` accepts `interval` (`1m`…`1mo`) and `range` (`1d`…`max`).

The server also runs a **background alert engine**: it evaluates the stored
alert rules on a timer using the active provider and records fires — so alerts
keep evaluating even with no browser open. Rules + triggers persist to
`MIDAS_ALERTS_FILE` (the `midas-data` volume under Docker). Set
`MIDAS_ALERT_WEBHOOK` to **POST fires to a webhook** (a Discord or Slack
incoming-webhook URL works as-is) for delivery with no terminal open at all.
The `ALERT` panel's **Server** mode manages these rules.

With **auth enabled**, the terminal also **syncs each user's workspaces, paper
portfolio, watchlists and notes** to the server (`GET/PUT /api/workspaces`,
`/api/portfolio`, `/api/watchlists`, `/api/notes`): your panels, saved layouts,
positions, trade journal, named watchlists and notes are pushed (debounced) as
you change them and pulled back on login, so your whole setup follows your
account across devices. Each snapshot is an opaque blob the server stores per
user; with auth off the terminal keeps using local storage only, unchanged.

## Configuration

Server (environment variables):

| Variable              | Default     | Description                          |
| --------------------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------ |

| `MIDAS_CCXT_EXCHANGE` | `binance`   | Exchange id when provider is `ccxt`. |
| `PORT`                | `4000`      | API port.                           |
| `HOST`                | `0.0.0.0`   | API bind host.                      |
| `MIDAS_CORS_ORIGIN`   | `*`         | Allowed CORS origin.                |
| `LOG_LEVEL`           | `info`      | Pino log level.                     |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`   | —           | Enables the AI copilot (`AI`).       |
| `MIDAS_AI_MODEL`      | `claude-sonnet-4-6` | Claude model for the copilot.|
| `MIDAS_DATA_DIR`      | `./data`    | Where server state (alerts, users, workspaces, portfolios, watchlists, notes) is stored.|
| `MIDAS_ALERT_INTERVAL_MS` | `15000` | Background alert evaluation cadence.  |
| `MIDAS_ALERT_WEBHOOK` | —           | POST fired alerts here (Discord/Slack/custom).|
| `MIDAS_AUTH_ENABLED`  | `false`     | Require login (bearer token) for the API.|
| `MIDAS_AUTH_ALLOW_SIGNUP` | `true`  | Allow new accounts (first user always can).|
| `MIDAS_AUTH_SECRET`   | —           | Secret for signing session tokens.   |

Web (build-time): `VITE_API_TARGET` (dev proxy target),
`VITE_API_BASE` (API base URL when hosted separately).

## Roadmap

The foundation is intentionally small and extensible. Likely next steps:

- **Data:** more providers (Finnhub, Polygon, Alpha Vantage), real-time
  streaming via WebSocket, richer fundamentals (market cap, P/E, financials),
  server-side caching.
- **Modules:** options chain, depth/level-2, economic calendar, equity
  screener, portfolio/positions, comparison overlays, technical studies.
- **Workspaces:** multiple named layouts, panel linking (a symbol typed in one
  panel updates linked panels), command-driven panel targeting.
- **Charts:** multi-symbol compare overlays, persisted studies & drawings.
- **Platform:** multi-user auth for self-hosting, broader test coverage (UI /
  component tests). _(Docker Compose deploy + a Vitest suite wired into
  typecheck/build/test CI already shipped.)_
