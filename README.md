# MIDAS

A self-hosted, **Bloomberg-style market terminal** you run yourself. Type
mnemonic commands (`AAPL DES`, `NVDA GP`, `W`, `N`) into a command line to spawn
tiling panels — quotes, charts, watchlists, news — across a dense, dark
workspace. Inspired by [Gödel Terminal](https://godelterminal.com).

> Status: **v0.1 — foundation.** A working end-to-end vertical slice (command
> bar → tiling panels → live-updating modules → pluggable data backend). Built
> to grow for months. See the [Roadmap](#roadmap).
>
> **Direction:** Midas is heading toward a command-driven, self-hosted,
> **crypto-native** terminal (CCXT, no API keys). See [`VISION.md`](./VISION.md)
> and the [competitive teardown](./docs/research/godel-competitive-teardown.md).

## Highlights

- **Command-driven UI.** A Bloomberg-style command line with history,
  fuzzy autocomplete and "type anywhere to focus." `TICKER FUNCTION` grammar.
  A **⌘K / Ctrl-K command palette** fuzzy-jumps to any command or symbol.
- **Tiling panel workspace.** Drag, resize and arrange panels on a 12-column
  grid. Layout + watchlist persist in your browser.
- **Starter modules:** Description/quote (`DES`), price chart (`GP`/`GIP`),
  watchlist (`W`), quote monitor (`Q`), news (`N`/`TOP`), security finder
  (`SECF`), help (`HELP`).
- **Pluggable data layer.** Swap data sources behind one interface:
  - `mock` — deterministic synthetic market (default; works fully offline).
  - `yahoo` — live Yahoo Finance data (no API key).
- **Live ticker tape** and second-by-second market clock.
- **Typed end-to-end** with a shared data contract package.

## Quickstart

### Option A — Docker (one command, recommended)

Self-host the whole stack with [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/):

```bash
cp .env.example .env     # optional — defaults run the offline mock feed
docker compose up -d     # build + run web + API
```

Open <http://localhost:8080> and start typing: `BTC/USDT`, then `BTC/USDT GP`,
then `BTC/USDT BOOK`.

The **web** container (nginx) serves the built UI and reverse-proxies `/api`
(REST **and** the `/api/stream` WebSocket) to the **server** container, so the
browser talks to a single origin. Edit `.env` to switch providers or add your
`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, then `docker compose up -d --build` to apply.

```bash
docker compose logs -f      # tail logs
docker compose down         # stop
MIDAS_DATA_PROVIDER=ccxt MIDAS_WEB_PORT=9000 docker compose up -d --build   # live crypto on :9000
```

### Option B — local dev

```bash
# 1. Install (Node 20+ and pnpm)
pnpm install

# 2. Run web + API together (mock data, no network needed)
pnpm dev
#   → web:  http://localhost:5173
#   → api:  http://localhost:4000
```

Open <http://localhost:5173> and start typing: `BTC/USDT`, then `BTC/USDT GP`, then `BTC/USDT BOOK`.

### Use live market data

The API defaults to the offline `mock` provider. To pull **live** quotes,
charts and news from Yahoo Finance (no key required, needs internet):

```bash
MIDAS_DATA_PROVIDER=yahoo pnpm dev
```

For **live crypto** (no API key needed) via any [CCXT](https://github.com/ccxt/ccxt)
exchange — the cornerstone of Midas's [crypto-native direction](./VISION.md):

```bash
MIDAS_DATA_PROVIDER=ccxt MIDAS_CCXT_EXCHANGE=binance pnpm dev
# symbols use BASE/QUOTE, e.g. BTC/USDT, ETH/USDT
```

With the `ccxt` provider, the live order book, trades tape and ticker also stream
over **CCXT Pro** websockets (no API key needed for public market data).

| `AROON` | `AROONOSC`, `TRENDAGE` | no | Aroon board — trend by time-since-extreme per name: Aroon-Up / Aroon-Down (how recently the N-bar high vs low printed, 0–100) and the oscillator (up − down). Measures the age of the extreme, not price distance (distinct from HILO). |
| `CCI` | `CCI20`, `COMMODITY` | no | Commodity Channel Index board — each name's typical price vs its average ÷ mean deviation, with overbought (≥+100) / oversold (≤−100) flags: a mean-deviation oscillator distinct from RSI (gains/losses) and MFI (volume-weighted). |

| `PSAR` | `SAR`, `PARABOLIC` | no | Parabolic SAR board (Wilder stop-and-reverse) — the trailing-stop trend per name: long (stop below price) / short (stop above), the signed distance of the close from the stop, the acceleration factor (trend maturity), and a fresh-flip flag when the stop reverses. An iterative trailing-stop system, distinct from the ATR-band Supertrend (SUPER). |
| `WILLR` | `WILLIAMS`, `WPR` | no | Williams %R board — where each name's close sits in its N-bar high-low range on a 0 to −100 scale (0 = top, −100 = bottom), with overbought (≥−20) / oversold (≤−80) flags. A momentum oscillator close to Stochastic's %K but inverted and unsmoothed. |
| `UO` | `ULTIMATE`, `ULTOSC` | no | Ultimate Oscillator board (Larry Williams) — buying pressure ÷ true range blended over three timeframes (7/14/28) weighted 4:2:1 into a 0–100 reading per name, with overbought (≥70) / oversold (≤30) flags. Blends short/medium/long momentum to cut the false divergences single-period oscillators give. |
| `TRIX` | `TRIPLE`, `TRIXOSC` | no | TRIX board — the 1-period % rate-of-change of a triple-smoothed EMA of price per name, with its signal line (EMA of TRIX), the histogram (TRIX − signal), the zero-line side (up/down) and a fresh TRIX×signal cross. Triple smoothing filters the noise a single EMA leaves: a zero-line momentum oscillator, distinct from MACD (dual EMA). |
| `CMO` | `CHANDE`, `CMO14` | no | Chande Momentum Oscillator board — (Σ up-moves − Σ down-moves) ÷ their total × 100 over N bars per name, on a ±100 scale with overbought (≥+50) / oversold (≤−50) flags. Uses raw sums (not smoothed averages like RSI), so it swings harder: a distinct momentum gauge from the RSI / Stochastic / CCI family. |
| `ELDER` | `ELDERRAY`, `ERAY` | no | Elder-Ray board (Alexander Elder) — bull power (high − EMA) and bear power (low − EMA) per name as a % of the trend EMA, with the EMA slope as the up/down trend filter. Shows whether buyers or sellers control price relative to the trend: a buyer/seller-pressure board distinct from the oscillator family. |
| `FISHER` | `FISH`, `EHLERS` | no | Fisher Transform board (Ehlers) — normalizes each name's median price into its N-bar range and applies the Fisher transform to sharpen turning points, with the trigger line (prior Fisher) and a fresh Fisher×trigger cross. A reversal-oriented oscillator with crisper turns than the smooth momentum family. |
| `DPO` | `DETREND`, `DETRENDED` | no | Detrended Price Oscillator board — each name's close from floor(N/2)+1 bars ago minus its N-bar SMA (as a % of the SMA), with an above/below cycle-mean flag. Strips the trend to expose the price cycle around the average; reaches back (never forward) so the screener has no look-ahead. A cycle-oriented oscillator, distinct from the trend/momentum family. |
| `COPP` | `COPPOCK`, `COP` | no | Coppock Curve board — a 10-period weighted MA of each name's summed 14- and 11-bar rate-of-change, with its zero-line side and a fresh trough (up) / peak (down) turn. A trough turn near/below zero is Coppock's classic long-term buy signal: a slow, bottom-spotting momentum gauge distinct from the fast oscillator family. |
| `BOP` | `BALOP`, `BPOW` | no | Balance of Power board — (close − open) ÷ (high − low) per bar, smoothed over N bars on a −1..+1 scale, per name, with a buyers/sellers side and the latest candle's raw reading. Measures who won each candle (close vs open within the range): a simple buyer/seller-pressure gauge distinct from Elder-Ray. |
| `ADL` | `ACCDIST`, `CHAIKINAD` | no | Accumulation/Distribution line board (Chaikin) — the cumulative money-flow-volume line (close position in range × volume) per name, reported as its normalized slope over N bars (net flow ÷ volume), its trend, and a fresh N-bar A/D high (accumulation breakout) / low (distribution breakdown). A cumulative volume-flow gauge distinct from OBV. |
| `CMF` | `CHAIKINMF`, `CMFLOW` | no | Chaikin Money Flow board — Σ(money-flow volume) ÷ Σ(volume) over N bars per name, bounded −1..+1, with a buyers/sellers side and a strong-flow flag (\|CMF\| ≥ 0.25). The bounded oscillator sibling of the A/D line: positive is accumulation, negative distribution. |
| `FORCE` | `FORCEINDEX`, `EFI` | no | Force Index board (Elder) — (close − priorClose) × volume, EMA-smoothed over N bars per name, normalized as FI ÷ (price × avg volume) so it's comparable across names, with a bulls/bears side and a rising/falling flag. Ties the size of each move to the volume behind it: a zero-line volume oscillator. |
| `EOM` | `EMV`, `EASE` | no | Ease of Movement board (Arms) — midpoint move × range ÷ volume, SMA-smoothed over N bars per name and normalized to a dimensionless index, with an up/down ease side. Measures how readily price moves relative to the volume required: positive = rose easily (big move on light volume), negative = fell easily. A volume/price-efficiency oscillator. |
| `PVT` | `PRICEVOL`, `PVTREND` | no | Price Volume Trend board — the cumulative ((close − priorClose)/priorClose) × volume line per name, reported as its normalized slope over N bars (volume-weighted % return), its trend, and a fresh N-bar PVT high / low. Like OBV but scaled by the size of each move: a volume-confirmed trend line distinct from OBV and the A/D line. |
| `ALERT` | `ALRT`, `AL`   | optional     | Price / funding / 24h%-change alerts (above · below · cross), **local or server-backed** → toast / desktop. |
| `ACCT`  | `ACCOUNT`      | no           | Manage your account — password, sessions, and (admin) users.|

| `REPORT`| `EXPORT`, `CSV` | no         | Export your data to CSV — trade journal, transactions, positions, alert triggers and watchlists. |
| `NOTE`  | `NOTES`, `JRNL`, `MEMO` | no  | Free-form notes — global or per symbol, synced to your account.|
| `RISK`  | `SIZER`, `SIZE` | no          | Risk-based position sizer — size from account, risk %, entry & stop, with R-targets & liq. estimate. |
| `CONV`  | `NOTIONAL`, `CONVERT` | yes    | Size / notional converter — convert between quantity, notional, % of account and margin at the live price. |
| `KELLY` | `BETSIZE`, `OPTIMALF`, `KCRIT` | no | Kelly-criterion bet sizing — optimal bankroll fraction from win rate & payoff, with half/quarter Kelly, expectancy & breakeven win. |
| `ROR`   | `RUIN`, `RISKOFRUIN`, `ROFR` | no | Risk-of-ruin simulator — probability of blowing up from win rate, payoff & risk-per-trade, with expected max drawdown & a survival curve. |
| `LADDER` | `SCALEIN`, `RUNGS`, `SCALE` | no | Scale-in ladder planner — spread a budget across limit rungs over a price range (flat/linear/geometric) for a blended average entry. |
| `DCA`   | `AVG`, `AVERAGE`, `BASIS` | no | Average-cost calculator — blend fills into an average entry, mark P&L, liq. estimate + target-average solver. |
| `LOG`   | `JOURNAL`, `TJ` | no         | Trade journal — log entries/exits, score R-multiples, track win rate, expectancy & total R. Saved to your browser. |
| `EQ`    | `EQUITY`, `CURVE`, `DRAWDOWN` | no | Equity curve — cumulative R, max drawdown and streaks from your scored journal trades. |
| `PNL`   | `FEE`, `ROE`   | no           | Trade P&L & fee calculator — gross/net P&L, ROE, fees paid and fee-inclusive break-even. |
| `N`     | `NEWS`, `CN`   | optional     | Headlines for a symbol (or market if omitted).|
| `TOP`   | `MKT`          | no           | Top market-wide news.                         |
| `SECF`  | `FIND`, `SRCH` | no           | Search for securities by ticker or name.      |
| `HELP`  | `H`, `?`       | no           | Command list and usage.                       |

**Grammar:** `BTC/USDT` → description · `BTC/USDT GP` → chart · `BTC/USDT BOOK` → order book ·
bare `W`/`HELP` → symbol-less panels · unrecognized text → security search.

**Keyboard:** start typing anywhere to focus the command line · `↑/↓` recall
history or move through suggestions · `Tab` complete · `Esc` clear.

**Shortcuts:** `⌘K` / `Ctrl-K` command palette · `⌥1…⌥9` focus a panel by its
number · `⌥]` / `⌥[` focus next / previous · `⌥W` close the focused panel ·
`?` shows the full list (`⌥` = Alt / Option).

## Architecture

A pnpm monorepo with a typed contract shared by client and server.

```
midas/
├── packages/
│   └── shared/        @midas/shared — Quote, Candle, NewsItem… (the data contract)
├── apps/
│   ├── server/        @midas/server — Fastify API + pluggable data providers
│   │   └── src/providers/   DataProvider interface · MockProvider · YahooProvider
│   └── web/           @midas/web — React + Vite terminal UI
│       └── src/
│           ├── commands/    command registry, parser, executor
│           ├── store/       zustand stores (panels, watchlist) — persisted
│           ├── modules/     panel modules (DES, GP, W, Q, N, SECF, HELP)
│           └── components/  TopBar, CommandBar, Workspace, Panel, Ticker…
```

**Data flow:** the web client calls `/api/*` → Fastify routes → the active
`DataProvider`. In dev, Vite proxies `/api` to the server. Adding a data source
means implementing one interface (`apps/server/src/providers/types.ts`); adding
a panel type means writing a module component and registering it.

### API

| Route                              | Returns                          |
| ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| `GET /api/health`                  | provider id, live flag, version  |
| `GET /api/quote/:symbol`           | `Quote`                          |
| `GET /api/quotes?symbols=A,B,C`    | `Quote[]`                        |
| `GET /api/history/:symbol`         | `HistoryResponse` (OHLCV candles)|
| `GET /api/funding?quote=&limit=`   | `FundingRow[]` (top perps' funding + OI)|
| `GET /api/liquidations?quote=&limit=` | `LiquidationEvent[]` (market-wide feed)|
| `GET /api/search?q=`               | `SearchResult[]`                 |
| `GET /api/news?symbol=`            | `NewsItem[]`                     |
| `GET/POST/PATCH/DELETE /api/alerts` | server-side alert rules (CRUD)  |
| `GET /api/alerts/log`              | recent server-fired triggers     |
| `GET/PUT /api/workspaces`          | the user's synced workspace layout|
| `GET/PUT /api/portfolio`           | the user's synced paper portfolio |
| `GET/PUT /api/watchlists`          | the user's synced named watchlists|
| `GET/PUT /api/notes`               | the user's synced notes          |
| `GET /api/auth/status`             | whether auth is on / signup open |
| `POST /api/auth/signup\|login`     | create a session (returns a token)|
| `GET /api/auth/me`                 | the signed-in user (bearer token)|
| `POST /api/auth/password`          | change password (rotates other sessions)|
| `POST /api/auth/logout-all`        | sign out other devices (token rotation)|
| `GET/DELETE /api/auth/users`       | admin: list / remove accounts    |

`/api/history` accepts `interval` (`1m`…`1mo`) and `range` (`1d`…`max`).

The server also runs a **background alert engine**: it evaluates the stored
alert rules on a timer using the active provider and records fires — so alerts
keep evaluating even with no browser open. Rules + triggers persist to
`MIDAS_ALERTS_FILE` (the `midas-data` volume under Docker). Set
`MIDAS_ALERT_WEBHOOK` to **POST fires to a webhook** (a Discord or Slack
incoming-webhook URL works as-is) for delivery with no terminal open at all.
The `ALERT` panel's **Server** mode manages these rules.

With **auth enabled**, the terminal also **syncs each user's workspaces, paper
portfolio, watchlists and notes** to the server (`GET/PUT /api/workspaces`,
`/api/portfolio`, `/api/watchlists`, `/api/notes`): your panels, saved layouts,
positions, trade journal, named watchlists and notes are pushed (debounced) as
you change them and pulled back on login, so your whole setup follows your
account across devices. Each snapshot is an opaque blob the server stores per
user; with auth off the terminal keeps using local storage only, unchanged.

## Roadmap

The foundation is intentionally small and extensible. Likely next steps:

- **Data:** more providers (Finnhub, Polygon, Alpha Vantage), real-time
  streaming via WebSocket, richer fundamentals (market cap, P/E, financials),
  server-side caching.
- **Modules:** options chain, depth/level-2, economic calendar, equity
  screener, portfolio/positions, comparison overlays, technical studies.
- **Workspaces:** multiple named layouts, panel linking (a symbol typed in one
  panel updates linked panels), command-driven panel targeting.
- **Charts:** multi-symbol compare overlays, persisted studies & drawings.
- **Platform:** multi-user auth for self-hosting, broader test coverage (UI /
  component tests). _(Docker Compose deploy + a Vitest suite wired into
  typecheck/build/test CI already shipped.)_
